      " Recent experimental and theoretical research in Pt$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ have opened avenues for restoring Dirac dispersion in layered materials. Inspired by this we conducted first-principles DFT calculations unveiling a novel nonmagnetic metal Pt$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ with a robust Dirac dispersion. Under strong SOC and high pressure the Fermi surface topology shifts yielding spin valley intertwined Dirac cones and three fold charge density waves due to inversion symmetry breaking. Thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient exhibit an inverse relationship with temperature due to increased phonon collisions attributed to anharmonic phonon phonon interactions via Umklapp processes. Ab initio molecular dynamics and phonon dispersion calculations confirm the dynamic and thermal stability of Pt$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ illuminating the origin of its Dirac cone and electronic properties.\n",

      " Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. We additionally observe that moving to strong cavity field gradients leads to an instability towards a sliding Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase, featuring a strong density modulation in the gradient direction. Finally, by exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. We discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.\n",

      " Recent experimental discovery of fractional Chern insulator in moiré Chern band in twisted transition metal dichalocogenide homobilayers has sparked intensive interest in exploring the ways of engineering band topology and correlated states in moiré systems. In this letter, we demonstrate that, with an additional exchange interaction induced by proximity effect, the topology and bandwidth of the moiré minibands of twisted $\\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ homobilayers can be easily tuned. Fractional Chern insulators at -2/3 filling are found to appear at enlarged twist angles over a large range of twist angles with enhanced many-body gaps. We further discover a topological phase transition between the fractional Chern insulator, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, and charge density wave. Our results shed light on the interplay between topology and correlation physics.\n",

      " This study investigates the anisotropic effects on a system of three qubits with chain and ring topology, described by the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg XXX model subjected to a homogeneous magnetic field. We explore the Stirling and Otto cycles and find that easy-axis anisotropy significantly enhances engine efficiency across all cases. At low temperatures, the ring configuration outperforms the chain on both work and efficiency during the Stirling cycle. Additionally, in both topologies, the Stirling cycle achieves Carnot efficiency with finite work at quantum critical points. In contrast, the quasistatic Otto engine also reaches Carnot efficiency at these points but yields no useful work. Notably, the Stirling cycle exhibits all thermal operational regimes engine, refrigerator, heater, and accelerator unlike the quasistatic Otto cycle, which functions only as an engine or refrigerator.\n",

      " Motivated by recent advancements highlighting Ta as a promising material in low-loss superconducting circuits and showing long coherence times in superconducting qubits, we have explored the effect of cryogenic temperatures on the growth of Ta and its integration in superconducting circuits. Cryogenic growth of Ta using a low temperature molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system is found to stabilize single phase $\\alpha$-Ta on several different substrates, which include Al$\\mathrm{_2}$O$\\mathrm{_3}$(0001), Si(001), Si(111), SiN${_x}$, and GaAs(001). The substrates are actively cooled down to cryogenic temperatures and remain < 20 K during the Ta deposition. X-ray $\\theta$-2$\\theta$ diffraction after warming to room temperature indicates the formation of polycrystalline $\\alpha$-Ta. The 50 nm $\\alpha$-Ta films grown on Al$\\mathrm{_2}$O$\\mathrm{_3}$(0001) at a substrate manipulator temperature of 7 K have a room temperature resistivity ($\\mathrm{\\rho _{300 K}}$) of 13.4 $\\mathrm{\\mu \\Omega}$cm, a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of 17.3 and a superconducting transition temperature (T$_C$) of 4.14 K, which are comparable to bulk values. In addition, atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicates that the film grown at 7 K with an RMS roughness of 0.45 nm was significantly smoother than the one grown at room temperature. Similar properties are found for films grown on other substrates. Results for films grown at higher substrate manipulator temperatures show higher $\\mathrm{\\rho _{300 K}}$, lower RRR and Tc, and increased $\\beta$-Ta content. Coplanar waveguide resonators with a gap width of 3 $\\mathrm{\\mu}$m fabricated from cryogenically grown Ta on Si(111) and Al$\\mathrm{_2}$O$\\mathrm{_3}$(0001) show low power Q$_i$ of 1.9 million and 0.7 million, respectively, indicating polycrystalline $\\alpha$-Ta films may be promising for superconducting qubit applications even though they are not fully epitaxial.\n",

      " The blinking-checkers model [F. Caupin and M. A. Anisimov, Phys. Rev. Lett, 127,185701 (2021)] is a minimal lattice model which has demonstrated that, in the meanfield approximation, it can reproduce the phenomenon of fluid polyamorphism. This model is a binary lattice-gas, in which each site has three possible states: empty, occupied with particles of type 1, and occupied with particles of type 2. Additionally, the two types of particles may interconvert from one to another. Equilibrium interconversion imposes a constraint that makes this model thermodynamically equivalent to a single-component system. In this work, Monte-Carlo simulations of the blinking-checkers model are performed, demonstrating polyamorphic phase behavior. The locations of the liquid-liquid and liquid-gas critical points are found to be different from the meanfield predictions for this model with the same interaction parameters, as the phase behavior is significantly affected by critical fluctuations. Based on the computed values of the critical exponents of the order parameter, susceptibility, correlation length, and surface tension, we confirm that the blinking-checkers model, for both liquid-gas and liquid-liquid equilibria, belongs to the three-dimensional Ising class of critical-point universality.\n",

      " We explore the time evolution of a topological system when the system undergoes a sudden quantum quench within the same nontrivial phase. Using Haldane's honeycomb model as an example, we show that equilibrium states in a topological phase can be distinguished by geometrical features, such as the characteristic momentum at which the half-occupied edge modes cross, the associated edge-mode velocity, and the winding vector about which the normalized pseudospin magnetic field winds along a great circle on the Bloch sphere. We generalize these geometrical quantities for non-equilibrium states and use them to visualize the quench dynamics of the topological system. In general, we find the pre-quench equilibrium state relaxes to the post-quench equilibrium state in an oscillatory fashion, whose amplitude decay as $t^{1/2}$. In the process, however, the characteristic winding vector of the non-equilibrium system can evolve to regimes that are not reachable with equilibrium states.\n",

      " Kondo lattice systems are recognized for potentially hosting a variety of rich topological phases. Several pioneering studies have demonstrated significant anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst effects in these systems, attributed to the Berry curvature of the hybridization bands. In this study, we investigate UBiTe, a ferromagnetic Kondo lattice system. Our findings reveal that the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity is closely tied to the Kondo coherence temperature. Moreover, we demonstrate that slight shifts in the Fermi level across three different samples significantly influence this intrinsic contribution, in alignment with the Berry curvature localized within the narrow hybridization bands. This provides a stark contrast to the less pronounced sensitivity observed in weakly correlated Weyl semimetals, underscoring the distinctive electronic properties of Kondo lattice systems. The anomalous Hall conductivity of one samples ranks among the highest reported for topological magnetic materials.\n",

      " Metallic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), consisting of H-NbSe$_2$, H-NbS$_2$, H-TaSe$_2$ and H-TaS$_2$, remain superconducting down to a thickness of a single layer. In these materials, thickness affects a variety of properties, including Ising protection, two-band superconductivity, and the critical temperature $T_C$, which decreases for the Nb-based, and increases for the Ta-based materials. This contradicting trend is puzzling, and has precluded the development of a unified theory. We approach the question of thickness-evolution of $T_C$ and the superconducting gap $\\Delta$ by measuring high-resolution tunneling spectra in TaS$_2$-based stacked devices. Our measurements allow for simultaneous evaluation of $\\Delta$, $T_C$, and the upper critical field $H_{C2}$. The latter, we find, is strongly enhanced towards the single-layer limit, following a $H_{C2} \\propto \\Delta^2$ proportionality ratio. Our main finding is that the same ratio holds for the entire family of metallic TMDs: TaS$_2$ and NbSe$_2$ of all thicknesses, bulk TaSe$_2$ and bulk NbS$_2$, extending over 4 orders of magnitude in $H_{C2}$ and covering both clean and dirty limits. We propose that this tunability across the TMD family is controlled by the competing charge density wave (CDW) phase. Using Gor'kov's theory, we calculate how a CDW order affects the quasiparticle density of states and the resulting $T_C$ and $H_{C2}$. Our results suggest that CDW is the key determinant factor limiting $T_C$ in the TMD family. They also show that $H_{C2}$ is universally enhanced by a factor of two orders of magnitude above the expected value, an effect that remains an open question.\n",

      " We investigate the dynamical effects of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) on the superconducting properties of two-dimensional (2D) systems, calculating the Eliashberg function in terms of dynamically renormalized phonons. By studying different approximations for the phonon self-energy, we identify the important role of charge fluctuations in shaping the superconductivity properties, not only through the renormalization of phonon frequencies and damping rates but also through structural changes in the phonon spectral function. With the dynamical effects treated consistently, we argue that a part of the phonon spectral weight necessarily shifts to low frequencies due to the coupling to the 2D gapless plasmon. Furthermore, we find that the EPC leads to excess phonon spectral weight as well - i.e., phonon production - which generally tends to enhance the transition temperature. Our calculations point out that the influence of phonon production becomes greater as the density and the effective mass of electrons increase.\n",

      " The study of kagome materials has attracted much attention in the past few years due to the presence of many electron-electron interaction-driven phases in a single this http URL this work, we report the discovery of intrinsic spin-polarized p-wave superconductivity in the thin-flake kagome material RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Firstly, when an in-plane magnetic field is swept in opposite directions, we observe a unique form of hysteresis in magnetoresistance which is different from the hysteresis induced by extrinsic mechanisms such as flux-trapping or superheating and supercooling effects. The unconventional hysteresis indicates the emergence of an intrinsic time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting phase. Strikingly, at a fixed magnetic field, the finite-resistance state can be quenched to the zero-resistance state by applying a large current. Secondly, at temperatures around 400 mK, the re-entrance of superconductivity occurs during an in-plane field-sweeping process with a fixed sweeping direction. This kind of re-entrance is asymmetric about the zero field axis and observed in all field directions for a fixed current direction, which is different from the re-entrance observed in conventional superconductors. Moreover, the angle-dependent in-plane critical field measurements reveal a two-fold symmetry that deviates from the original, centrosymmetric D$_{6h}$ point group symmetry of the crystal. These findings put very strong constraints on the possible superconducting pairing symmetry of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. We point out that the pairing symmetry, which is consistent with the crystal symmetry and all the observed novel properties, is a time-reversal symmetry-breaking, p-wave pairing with net spin polarization. Importantly, this p-wave pairing gives rise to a nodal topological superconducting state with Majorana flat bands on the sample edges.\n",

      " Motivated by recent experimental observations of displacement-field-tuned correlated insulators at integer and half-integer fillings in chirally twisted triple bilayer graphene (CTTBG), we study the single-particle and interacting physics of CTTBG. We find that there are two inequivalent stacking orders, {\\it i.e.}, ABABBC and ABABAB, and both exhibit flat bands with nontrivial topology. We then use the Hartree-Fock approximation to calculate the rich phase diagram of CTTBG at all integer and half-integer fillings in both stacking orders and under the vertical displacement field. Under a small displacement field, the groundstates are flavor polarized states for ABABBC stacking order and intervalley coherent states for ABABAB stacking order at all integer and half-integer fillings. A larger displacement field will turn them into layer-polarized states. At half-integer fillings, the groundstates also exhibit charge density wave (CDW) order. For ABABAB stacking, the groundstates are always $2\\times1$ stripe state among a range of displacement fields. For ABABBC stacking, the groundstates are also $2\\times1$ stripe states under a small displacement field and a larger displacement will possibly favor further translation-symmetry-breaking, depending on filling and the direction of the displacement field. We demonstrate that the CDW states observed in the experiment can originate from the strong Coulomb interaction of the flat band electrons.\n",

      " We demonstrate evidence of correlated magnetism for exciton-polaritons in a MoSe$_{2}$/WS$_{2}$ moiré heterostructure with near-parallel alignment subject to electron doping. In our experiments, interactions between electrons and moiré excitons are controlled electrostatically by field-effect doping, and the polaritonic regime of strong light-matter coupling is established in an open cryogenic microcavity. Remarkably, at filling fractions around one electron per moiré cell, we observe drastic and nonlinear enhancement of the effective polariton Landé factor as a hallmark of correlated magnetism, which is cavity-controlled via resonance tuning of light and matter polariton constituents. Our work establishes moiré van der Waals heterostructures as an outstanding platform for studies of correlated phenomena in the presence of strong light-matter coupling and many-body phases of lattice-ordered excitons, charges and spins.\n",

      " We study the phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice with $S=1$ spins at zero and finite temperatures. We use a combination of complementary state-of-the-art quantum many-body approaches such as density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), density-matrix purification and pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group (PMFRG). We present an efficient approach to preserve the applicability of the PMFRG for spin-1 systems at finite temperatures despite the inevitable presence of unphysical spin states. The good performance of our methods is first demonstrated for the nearest-neighbor pyrochlore Heisenberg model where the finite temperature behavior of the specific heat and uniform susceptibility show excellent agreement within PMFRG and density-matrix purification. Including an antiferromagnetic second neighbor coupling we find that the non-magnetic ground-state phase of the nearest neighbor model extents up to $J_2/J_1 \\sim 0.02 $ within DMRG, beyond which magnetic $\\boldsymbol{k}=0$ long-range order sets in. Our PMFRG calculations find the phase transition in a similar regime $J_2/J_1\\sim 0.035(8)$ which, together with the DMRG result, provides a strong argument for the existence of a small but finite non-magnetic ground-state phase in the spin-1 pyrochlore Heisenberg model. We also discuss the origin of discrepancies between different versions of the functional renormalization group concerning the location of this phase transition.\n",

      " The stacking order and twist angle provide abundant opportunities for engineering band structures of two-dimensional materials, including the formation of moire bands, flat bands, and topologically nontrivial bands. The inversion symmetry breaking in rhombohedral-stacked transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) endows them with an interfacial ferroelectricity associated with an out-of-plane electric polarization. By utilizing twist angle as a knob to construct rhombohedral-stacked TMDCs, antiferroelectric domain networks with alternating out-of-plane polarization can be generated. Here, we demonstrate that such spatially periodic ferroelectric polarizations in parallel-stacked twisted WSe2 can imprint their moire potential onto a remote bilayer graphene. This remote moire potential gives rise to pronounced satellite resistance peaks besides the charge-neutrality point in graphene, which are tunable by the twist angle of WSe2. Our observations of ferroelectric hysteresis at finite displacement fields suggest the moire is delivered by a long-range electrostatic potential. The constructed superlattices by moire ferroelectricity represent a highly flexible approach, as they involve the separation of the moire construction layer from the electronic transport layer. This remote moire is identified as a weak potential and can coexist with conventional moire. Our results offer a comprehensive strategy for engineering band structures and properties of two-dimensional materials by utilizing moire ferroelectricity.\n",

Focusing on phonon-mediating superconductivity, one would propose to promote critical temperature by substituting heavy elements by lighter ones, in order to increase Debye temperature. Following recent experimental progress in transition-metal nitrides and theoretically revealing W$_2$N$_3$ as a candidate for high-temperature superconductivity, we investigate the possibility of two-dimensional superconductivity through surface engineering on MoN$_2$. Using density functional theory calculation, we found multigap superconductivity at temperature up to 36K within anisotropic Eliashberg equation in passivated electride-like surfaces. We also demonstrate their possibility to sustain topological superconductivity with strong spin-orbital coupling.\n",

      " We investigate the occurrence of direct and dual Shapiro steps for a Josephson junction coupled to a finite-size transmission line resonator. We treat both problems through a circuit QED approach with a large, but finite number of photon modes. For the dual case, we do not assume the (approximate) charge-phase duality, but include the full multi-band dynamics for the Josephson junction. Mean-field equations within such Hamiltonian approach reproduce the result obtained through a dissipative classical equation when the number of transmission line modes is large enough. To account for quantum and thermal fluctuations, we go beyond the mean-field treatment within a truncated Wigner approach. The fluctuations are shown to modify both the direct and the dual steps. We show how the dual steps are very sensitive to these fluctuations and identify the key physical parameters for the junction and the transmission line controlling their robustness, which is essential for applications to close the quantum metrological triangle.\n",

      " The strong coupling of plasmonic resonance modes in conductive pyramidal nanoparticles leads to an increase in the density of free charges on the surface. By ensuring plasmonic coupling in the pyramidal nanoparticle lattice, the achieved field intensity is potentiated. At the same time, a strong coupling between resonant modes is guaranteed, which results in the formation of new hybrid modes. In this manuscript, we demonstrated a tunable double anticrossing interaction that results from the interaction between two Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) modes and a Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) wave. The tuning is done as a function of the variation of the angle of incidence of the input electric field. From the double anticrossing, an increase in field intensity in a blue-shifted LSPR mode located in the red wavelength region is observed. This demonstrates that at certain angles of incidence, the intensity field obtained is strongly favored, which would be beneficial for applications such as Surface Enhancement Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). Nanoparticle-based lattices have been widely used for biosensor applications. However, one of the major limitations of this type of device is the low tolerance to high concentrations of biomolecules, which significantly affects their performance. According to the studies carried out for this manuscript, it was demonstrated that the implemented geometry allows for the observation of an LSPR mode, which is responsible for the control and synchronization of other perceived resonances. This mode remains almost invariant when subjected to structural variations or changes in the angle of incidence of the electric field. These characteristics eliminate the limitation mentioned above, allowing for sensitivities 10^3 times higher than those achieved in conventional systems based on LSPR used to detect P. brasiliensis antigen.\n",

      " World-wide efforts aim at the realization of advanced quantum simulators and processors. However, despite the development of intricate hardware and pulse control systems, it may still not be generally known which effective quantum dynamics, or channels, are implemented on these devices. To systematically infer those, we propose a neural-network algorithm approximating generic discrete-time dynamics through the repeated action of an effective quantum channel. We test our approach considering time-periodic Lindblad dynamics as well as non-unitary subsystem dynamics in many-body unitary circuits. Moreover, we exploit it to investigate cross-talk effects on the ibmq_ehningen quantum processor, which showcases our method as a practically applicable tool for inferring quantum channels when the exact nature of the underlying dynamics on the physical device is not known a priori. While the present approach is tailored for learning Markovian dynamics, we discuss how it can be adapted to also capture generic non-Markovian discrete-time evolutions.\n",

      " Active wavelength-scale optoelectronic components are widely used in photonic integrated circuitry, however coherent sources of light -- namely optical lasers -- remain the most challenging component to integrate. Semiconductor nanowire lasers represent a flexible class of light source where each nanowire is both gain material and cavity; however, strong coupling between these properties and the performance leads to inhomogeneity across the population. While this has been studied and optimized for individual material systems, no architecture-wide insight is available. Here, nine nanowire laser material systems are studied and compared using 55,516 nanowire lasers to provide statistically robust insight into performance. These results demonstrate that, while it may be important to optimise internal quantum efficiency for certain materials, cavity effects are always critical. Our study provides a roadmap to optimize the performance of nanowire lasers made from any material: this can be achieved by ensuring a narrow spread of lengths and end-facet reflectivities.\n",

      " We propose a novel mechanism for generating single photons in the mid-Infrared (MIR) using a solid-state or molecular quantum emitter. The scheme utilises cavity QED effects to selectively enhance a Frank-Condon transition, deterministically preparing a single Fock state of a polar phonon mode. By coupling the phonon mode to an antenna, the resulting excitation is then radiated to the far field as a single photon with a frequency matching the phonon mode. By combining macroscopic QED calculations with methods from open quantum system theory, we show that optimal parameters to generate these MIR photons occur for modest light-matter coupling strengths, which are achievable with state-of-the-art technologies. Combined, the cascaded system we propose provides a new quasi-deterministic source of heralded single photons in a regime of the electromagnetic spectrum where this previously was not possible.\n",

      " Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials have attracted substantial interest due to their remarkable excitonic, optical, electrical, and mechanical properties, which are highly dependent on their crystal structure. Controlling the crystal structure of these materials is essential for fine-tuning their performance, $\\textit{e.g.}$, linear and nonlinear optical, as well as charge transport properties. While various phase-switching TMD materials, like molybdenum telluride (MoTe$_2$), are available, their transitions are often irreversible. Here, we investigate the mechanism of a light-induced reversible phase transition in mono- and bilayer flakes of rhenium disulfide (ReS$_2$). Our observations, based on scanning transmission electron microscopy, nonlinear spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, reveal a transition from the ground T$''$ (double distorted T) to the metastable H$'$ (distorted H) phase under femtosecond laser irradiation or influence of highly-energetic electrons. We show that the formation of sulfur vacancies facilitates this phenomenon. Our findings pave the way towards actively manipulating the crystal structure of ReS$_2$ and possibly its heterostructures.\n",

      " Topological insulators are described by topological invariants that can be computed by integrals over momentum space, but also as traces over local, real-space topological markers. These markers are useful to detect topological insulating phases in disordered crystals, quasicrystals and amorphous systems. Among these markers, only the spectral localizer operator can be used to distinguish topological metals, that show zero-modes of the localizer spectrum. However, it remains unclear whether trivial metals also display zero-modes, and if their localizer spectrum is distinguishable from topological ones. Here, we show that trivial metals generically display zero-modes of the localizer spectrum. The localizer zero-modes are determined by the zero-mode solutions of a Dirac equation with a varying mass parameter. We use this observation, valid in any dimension, to determine the difference between the localizer spectrum of trivial and topological metals, and conjecture the spectrum of the localizer for fractional quantum Hall edges. Because the localizer is a local, real-space operator, it may be used as a tool to differentiate between non-crystalline topological and trivial metals, and characterize strongly correlated systems, for which local topological markers are scarce.\n",

      " The one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is central to band topology in condensed matter physics, which allows us to understand and design distinct topological states. In this work, we find another mechanism to analogize the SSH model in a spinful system, realizing an obstructed atomic insulator by introducing intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and in-plane Zeeman field. In our model, the midgap states originate from a quantized hidden polarization with invariant index $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ (0; 01) due to the local inversion symmetry breaking. When the global inversion symmetry is broken, a charge pumping is designed by tuning the polarization. Moreover, by introducing the $p+ip$ superconductor pairing potential, a new topological phase dubbed obstructed superconductor (OSC) is identified. This new state is characterized by invariant index $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ (0; 01) and nonchiral midgap states. More interestingly, these nonchiral edge states result in a chiral-like nonlocal conductance, which is different from the traditional chiral topological superconductor. Our findings not only find another strategy to achieve a spinful SSH model but also predict the existence of OSC, providing a promising avenue for further exploration of its transport properties.\n",

      " It has been observed in fossil tracks and experiments in the layered silicate mica muscovite the transport of charge through the cation layers sandwiched between the layers of tetrahedra-octahedra-tetrahedra. A classical model for the propagation of anharmonic vibrations along the cation chains has been proposed based on first principles and empirical functions. In that model, several propagating entities have been found as kinks or crowdions and breathers, both with or without wings, the latter for specific velocities and energies. Crowdions are equivalent to moving interstitials and transport electric charge if the moving particle is an ion, but they also imply the movement of mass, which was not observed in the experiments. Breathers, being just vibrational entities, do not transport charge. In this work, we present a semiclassical model obtained by adding a quantum particle, electron or hole to the previous model. We present the construction of the model based on the physics of the system. In particular, the strongly nonlinear vibronic interaction between the nuclei and the extra electron or hole is essential to explain the localized charge transport, which is not compatible with the adiabatic approximation. The formation of vibrational localized charge carriers breaks the lattice symmetry group in a similar fashion to the Jahn-Teller Effect, providing a new stable dynamical state. We study the properties and the coherence of the model through numerical simulations from initial conditions obtained by tail analysis and other means. We observe that although the charge spreads from an initial localization in a lattice at equilibrium, it can be confined basically to a single particle when coupled to a chaotic quasiperiodic breather. This is coherent with the observation that experiments imply that a population of charge is formed due to the decay of potassium unstable isotopes.\n",

      " Emergent quasiparticles with a Dirac dispersion in condensed matter systems can be described by the Dirac equation for relativistic electrons, in analogy with Dirac particles in high-energy physics. For example, electrons with a Dirac dispersion have been intensively studied in electronic systems such as graphene and topological insulators. However, charge is not a prerequisite for Dirac fermions, and the emergence of Dirac fermions without charge degree of freedom has been theoretically predicted to be realized in Dirac quantum spin liquids. These quasiparticles carry a spin of 1/2 but are charge-neutral, and so are called spinons. Here we show that the spin excitations of a kagome antiferromagnet, YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{0.33}$(OD)$_{0.67}$], are conical with a spin continuum inside, which is consistent with the convolution of two Dirac spinons. The predictions of a Dirac spin liquid model with a spinon velocity obtained from the spectral measurements are in agreement with the low-temperature specific heat of the sample. Our results thus provide spectral evidence for the Dirac quantum spin liquid state emerging in this kagome lattice antiferromagnet. However, the locations of the conical spin excitations differ from those calculated by the nearest neighbor Heisenberg model, suggesting the Dirac spinons have an unexpected origin.\n",

      " In this work, we study topological properties of magnons via creating spin excitations in both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets on a two-dimensional square lattice. It is known that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) plays an important role in coupling between different particle (spin excitation) sectors, here we consider an anisotropic DMI and ascertain the role of the anisotropy parameter in inducing topological phase transitions. We have extended the formalism for studying magnon band topology for the antiferromagnetic case, which facilitates a comparison between the two magnetically ordered systems. Owing to the presence of a two-sublattice structure of an antiferromagnet, a larger number of bands participate in unraveling the topological properties. However, in both the cases, an extended trivial region is observed even with the DMI to be non-zero, which is surprising since the DMI is the origin of finite Berry curvature due to the violation of effective time reversal symmetry. Furthermore, in an antiferromagnet, a smaller anisotropy is capable of inducing a gap-closing transition from a topological to a trivial phase compared to that for a ferromagnet. The nature of the phases in both the cases and the phase transitions therein are characterized by the band structure, presence (or absence) of the chiral edge modes, computation of the thermal Hall effect, etc. Moreover, an external magnetic field is found to play a decisive role in controlling the critical point that demarcates various topological phases.\n",

      " We investigate the Josephson diode effect in topological Josephson junctions. By both analytic and numerical calculations, we find that while a Josephson junction in the topological phase may exhibit higher diode efficiency compared to that in the trivial phase, this behavior is not universal. The presence of Majorana bound states is not a sufficient condition for a large diode effect. Furthermore, the diode efficiency undergoes substantial changes only in specific regions along the topological phase transition boundary, and a significant diode effect does coincide with the topological phases. Thereby our paper suggests the utilization of topological superconductivity for enhanced JDE, and also the Josephson diode effect may serve as an indicator for topological superconductor phase. These results suggest a nuanced relationship between the topological aspects of Josephson junctions and Josephson diode effect.\n",

      " Many fibrous materials are modeled as elastic networks featuring a substantial separation between the stiffness scales that characterize different microscopic deformation modes of the network's constituents. This scale separation has been shown to give rise to emergent complexity in these systems' linear and nonlinear mechanical response. Here we study numerically a simple model featuring said stiffness scale-separation in two-dimensions and show that its mechanical response is governed by the competition between the characteristic stiffness of collective nonphononic soft modes of the stiff subsystem, and the characteristic stiffness of the soft interactions. We present and rationalize the behavior of the shear modulus of our complex networks across the unjamming transition at which the stiff subsystem alone loses its macroscopic mechanical rigidity. We further establish a relation in the soft-interaction-dominated regime between the shear modulus, the characteristic frequency of nonphononic vibrational modes, and the mesoscopic correlation length that marks the crossover from a disorder-dominated response to local mechanical perturbations in the near-field, to a linear, continuum-like response in the far field. The effects of spatial dimension on the observed scaling behavior are discussed, in addition to the interplay between stiffness scales in strain-stiffened networks, which is relevant to understanding the nonlinear mechanics of non-Brownian fibrous biomatter.\n",

      " A growing number of superconducting materials display evidence for spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) below their critical transition temperatures. Precisely what this implies for the nature of the superconducting ground state of such materials, however, is often not straightforward to infer. We review the experimental status and survey different theoretical mechanisms for the generation of TRSB in superconductors. In cases where a TRSB complex combination of two superconducting order parameter components is realized, defects, dislocations and sample edges may generate superflow patterns that can be picked up by magnetic probes. However, even single-component condensates that do not break time-reversal symmetry in their pure bulk phases can also support signatures of magnetism inside the superconducting state. This includes, for example, the generation of localized orbital current patterns or spin-polarization near atomic-scale impurities, twin boundaries and other defects. Signals of TRSB may also arise from a superconductivity-enhanced Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida exchange coupling between magnetic impurity moments present in the normal state. We discuss the relevance of these different mechanisms for TRSB in light of recent experiments on superconducting materials of current interest.\n",

      " The microscopic origin of the topological magnon band gap in CrI$_3$ ferromagnets has been a subject of controversy for years since two main models with distinct characteristics, i.e., Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) and Kitaev, provided possible explanations with different outcome implications. Here we investigate the angular magnetic field dependence of the magnon gap of CrI$_3$ by elucidating what main contributions play a major role in its generation. We implement stochastic atomistic spin dynamics simulations to compare the impact of these two spin interactions on the magnon spectra. We observe three distinct magnetic field dependencies between these two gap opening mechanisms. First, we demonstrate that the Kitaev-induced magnon gap is influenced by both the direction and amplitude of the applied magnetic field, while the DM-induced gap is solely affected by the magnetic field direction. Second, the position of the Dirac cones within the Kitaev-induced magnon gap shifts in response to changes in the magnetic field direction, whereas they remain unaffected by the magnetic field direction in the DM-induced gap scenario. Third, we find a direct-indirect magnon band-gap transition in the Kitaev model by varying the applied magnetic field direction. These differences may distinguish the origin of topological magnon gaps in CrI$_3$ and other van der Waals magnetic layers. Our findings pave the way for exploration and engineering topological gaps in van der Waals materials.\n",

      " The Yao-Lee model is an example of exactly solvable spin-orbital models that are generalizations of the original Kitaev honeycomb model with extra local orbital degrees of freedom. Similar to the Kitaev model, both spin and orbital degrees of freedom are effectively represented using sets of three-flavored Majorana fermions. The Yao-Lee model exhibits a quantum spin liquid ground state with gapped and immobile $Z_2$ fluxes and three-fold degenerate itinerant Majorana fermions. Our work demonstrated that by introducing different time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking fields one can split the degeneracy of Majorana fermions and close the gap for some of the bands, thus changing its topology. We calculated a comprehensive topological phase diagram for the Yao-Lee model by considering various combinations of TRS-breaking fields. This investigation revealed the emergence of distinct topological regions, each separated by nodal lines, signifying an evolution in the model's topological properties. We also investigated the impact of vacancies in the system. Our findings revealed that while vacancies modify the low-energy spectrum of the model, their presence has a limited impact on the topological properties of the model, at least for small enough concentrations.\n",

By analyzing the stability matrix, we show that LCs arise due to a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. We find that the existence of LCs is independent of the sign of the effective nonlinear interaction. The LC phase can be classified as a continuous time crystal (CTC), if it emerges in a many-body system. The bosonic model can be realised in three-level systems interacting with a quantised light mode as realised in atom-cavity systems. Using such a platform, we experimentally observe LCs for the first time in an atom-cavity system with attractive optical pump lattice, thereby confirming our theoretical predictions.\n",

      " Inspired by recent experimental synthesis of the two-dimensional Janus material MoSH, we have performed extensive first-principles calculations to investigate the characteristics of all possible Janus two-dimensional transition metal hydrosulfides (JTMSHs), in both the 2H and 1T phases. Our investigations revealed that the JTMSHs can form a unique family of two-dimensional materials with intriguing physical and chemical properties. In details, we have found that JTMSHs can exist in various states, exhibiting metallic, semiconducting, and magnetic character. One particularly intriguing finding considered identification of electride states with distinct bonding characteristics in the 2H-JTMSHs for TM=V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W and Tc. Additionally, we have observed evidence of charge density wave scenario in 1T-JTMSH with TM=Tc, Re, and W and 2H-JTMSH with TM = Tc. Importantly, by applying compressive strain to these materials, the charge density wave can be completely suppressed, eventually leading to the superconducting phase. In particular, we have shown that when subjected to a compressive strain within 10%, the superconducting transition temperature (TC) of 1T-WSH, 1T-TcSH and 2H-TcSH can reach values of 13.8, 16.2 and 24.2 K respectively. Moreover, our investigation also unveiled two intrinsic phonon-mediated superconductors, namely 2H-WSH and 1T-RuSH with TC of 17.0 and 8 K, respectively.\n",

      " The energy levels of quasiparticles in superconductors experience Doppler shifts due to the influence of a finite current flow. The influence of the Doppler shift is particularly pronounced in unconventional superconductors with gap nodes. In the case of a normal/insulator/superconductor junction of $d$-wave superconductors, a zero-bias conductance peak exhibits a peak shift in an applied magnetic field. Although the shifts have been detected in experiments, the shifts showed different field responses depending on each experiment. In this paper, we evaluate the magnitude of the shift based on realistic junction shapes to elucidate the origin of the variability in experimental Doppler shifts. We find that the peak shift depends on the junction shape; the splitting is significantly suppressed when the junction is formed at a protruding position. Also, the shift is suppressed by the penetration of magnetic flux quanta, resulting in a nonlinear response to the magnetic field. The present results explain the origin of the variability in experimental Doppler shifts.\n",

      " This work is concerned with tree tensor network operators (TTNOs) for representing quantum Hamiltonians. We first establish a mathematical framework connecting tree topologies with state diagrams. Based on these, we devise an algorithm for constructing a TTNO given a Hamiltonian. The algorithm exploits the tensor product structure of the Hamiltonian to add paths to a state diagram, while combining local operators if possible. We test the capabilities of our algorithm on random Hamiltonians for a given tree structure. Additionally, we construct explicit TTNOs for nearest neighbour interactions on a tree topology. Furthermore, we derive a bound on the bond dimension of tensor operators representing arbitrary interactions on trees. Finally, we consider an open quantum system in the form of a Heisenberg spin chain coupled to bosonic bath sites as a concrete example. We find that tree structures allow for lower bond dimensions of the Hamiltonian tensor network representation compared to a matrix product operator structure. This reduction is large enough to reduce the number of total tensor elements required as soon as the number of baths per spin reaches $3$.\n",

      " In the standard lattice domain-wall fermion formulation, one needs two flat domain-walls where both of the left- and right-handed massless modes appear. In this work we investigate a single domain-wall system with a nontrivial curved background. Specifically we consider a massive fermion on a $3D$ square lattice, whose domain-wall is a $2D$ sphere. In the free theory, we find that a single Weyl fermion is localized at the wall and it feels gravity through the induced spin connection. With a topologically nontrivial $U(1)$ link gauge field, however, we find a zero mode with the opposite chirality localized at the center where the gauge field is singular. In the latter case, the low-energy effective theory is not chiral but vectorlike. We discuss how to circumvent this obstacle in formulating lattice chiral gauge theory in the single domain-wall fermion system.\n",

      " This study presents a detailed analysis of critical phenomena in a holographic Weyl semi-metal (WSM) using the $D3/D7$ brane configuration. The research explores the non-linear response of the longitudinal current \\( J \\) when subjected to an external electric field \\( E \\) at both zero and finite temperatures. At zero temperature, the study identifies a potential quantum phase transition in the \\( J \\)-\\( E \\) relationship, driven by background parameters the particle mass, and axial gauge potential. This transition is characterized by a unique reconnection phenomenon resulting from the interplay between WSM-like and conventional nonlinear conducting behaviors, indicating a quantum phase transition. Additionally, at non-zero temperature with dissipation, the system demonstrates first- and second-order phase transitions as the electric field and axial gauge potential are varied. The longitudinal conductivity is used as an order parameter to identify the current-driven phase transition. Numerical analysis reveals critical exponents in this non-equilibrium phase transition that show similarities to mean-field values observed in metallic systems.\n",

However, in the current phase of quantum computing development, known as the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era (NISQ), learning is difficult due to a limited number of qubits and widespread quantum noise. To overcome these challenges, researchers are focusing on variational quantum circuits (VQCs). VQCs are hybrid algorithms that merge a quantum circuit, which can be adjusted through parameters, with traditional classical optimization techniques. These circuits require only few qubits for effective learning. Recent studies have presented new ways of applying VQCs to reinforcement learning, showing promising results that warrant further exploration. This study investigates the effects of various techniques -- data re-uploading, input scaling, output scaling -- and introduces exponential learning rate decay in the quantum proximal policy optimization algorithm's actor-VQC. We assess these methods in the popular Frozen Lake and Cart Pole environments. Our focus is on their ability to reduce the number of parameters in the VQC without losing effectiveness. Our findings indicate that data re-uploading and an exponential learning rate decay significantly enhance hyperparameter stability and overall performance. While input scaling does not improve parameter efficiency, output scaling effectively manages greediness, leading to increased learning speed and robustness.\n",

      " Quantum kernel methods are a proposal for achieving quantum computational advantage in machine learning. They are based on a hybrid classical-quantum computation where a function called the quantum kernel is estimated by a quantum device while the rest of the computation is performed classically. Quantum advantages may be achieved through this method only if the quantum kernel function cannot be estimated efficiently on a classical computer. In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions for the efficient classical estimation of quantum kernel functions for bosonic systems. Specifically, we show that if the negativity in the phase-space quasi-probability distributions of data-encoding quantum states associated with the quantum kernel scales at most polynomially with the size of the quantum circuit, then the kernel function can be estimated efficiently classically. We consider quantum optical examples involving linear-optical networks with and without adaptive non-Gaussian measurements and investigate the effects of loss on the efficiency of the classical simulation. Our results underpin the role of the negativity in phase-space quasi-probability distributions as an essential resource in quantum machine learning based on kernel methods.\n",

This is an extremely challenging task, experimental as well as theoretical, also because there is currently no single easily computable measure of quality for these states. We introduce such measure, GKP squeezing, and show how it is related to the current ways of characterizing the states. The measure is easy to compute and can be easily employed in state preparation as well as verification of experimental results.\n",

      " In this paper, we explore the embedding of nonlinear dynamical systems into linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) via the Carleman linearization method. Under dissipative conditions, numerous previous works have established rigorous error bounds and linear convergence for Carleman linearization, which have facilitated the identification of quantum advantages in simulating large-scale dynamical systems. Our analysis extends these findings by exploring error bounds beyond the traditional dissipative condition, thereby broadening the scope of quantum computational benefits to a new class of dynamical regimes. This novel regime is defined by a resonance condition, and we prove how this resonance condition leads to a linear convergence with respect to the truncation level $N$ in Carleman linearization. We support our theoretical advancements with numerical experiments on a variety of models, including the Burgers' equation, Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) chains, and the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, to validate our analysis and demonstrate the practical implications.\n",

      " Tensor cross interpolation (TCI) is a powerful technique for learning a tensor train (TT) by adaptively sampling a target tensor based on an interpolation formula. However, when the tensor evaluations contain random noise, optimizing the TT is more advantageous than interpolating the noise. Here, we propose a new method that starts with an initial guess of TT and optimizes it using non-linear least-squares by fitting it to measured points obtained from TCI. We use quantics TCI (QTCI) in this method and demonstrate its effectiveness on sine and two-time correlation functions, with each evaluated with random noise. The resulting TT exhibits increased robustness against noise compared to the QTCI method. Furthermore, we employ this optimized TT of the correlation function in quantum simulation based on pseudo-imaginary-time evolution, resulting in ground-state energy with higher accuracy than the QTCI or Monte Carlo methods.\n",

In particular, we present a comprehensive theory of nonlinear nuclear excitation in thin-film x-ray cavities by focused x-ray pulses. We thereby identify cavity geometries with broad resonances which allow one to boost the nuclear excitation even at moderately tight focusing.\n",

      " In recent years, quantum Fourier transform infrared (QFTIR) spectroscopy was proposed as an alternative to conventional spectroscopy in the mid-infrared region of the spectrum. In this way, harnessing induced coherence and spectral entanglement offers perspectives for practical organic gasses detection. Still, little research was conducted in order to bring QFTIR spectrometers closer to domestic or in-field usage. In this work, we first use such a spectrometer for open-path detection of multiple interfering organic gasses in ambient air. The accurate identification of mixtures of acetone, methanol and ethanol vapors is demonstrated with a QFTIR spectrometer. We achieved this breakthrough by using a nonlinear Michelson interferometer with 1.7m-long arms in order to increase the absorption length, coupled with analysis techniques from differential optical absorption spectroscopy. The evolution of different gasses' concentrations in ambient air was measured through time. These results constitute the first use-case of a QFTIR spectrometer as a detector of organic gasses, and thus represent an important milestone towards the development of such detectors in practical situations.\n",

      " Quantum computation is an emerging technology with important potential for solving certain problems pivotal in various scientific and engineering disciplines. This paper introduces an efficient quantum protocol for the explicit construction of the block-encoding for an important class of Hamiltonians. Using the Schrodingerisation technique -- which converts non-conservative PDEs into conservative ones -- this particular class of Hamiltonians is shown to be sufficient for simulating any linear partial differential equations that have coefficients which are polynomial functions. The class of Hamiltonians consist of discretisations of polynomial products and sums of position and momentum operators. This construction is explicit and leverages minimal one- and two-qubit operations. The explicit construction of this block-encoding forms a fundamental building block for constructing the unitary evolution operator for this Hamiltonian. The proposed algorithm exhibits polynomial scaling with respect to the spatial partitioning size, suggesting an exponential speedup over classical finite-difference methods. This work provides an important foundation for building explicit and efficient quantum circuits for solving partial differential equations.\n",

      " The exploration of the root structure of coupled cluster equations holds both foundational and practical significance for computational quantum chemistry. This study provides insight into the intricate root structures of these non-linear equations at both the CCD and CCSD level of theory. We utilize computational techniques from algebraic geometry, specifically the monodromy and parametric homotopy continuation methods, to calculate the full solution set. We compare the computed CC roots against various established theoretical upper bounds, shedding light on the accuracy and efficiency of these bounds. We hereby focus on the dissociation processes of four-electron systems such as (H$_2$)$_2$ in both D$_{2{\\rm h}}$ and D$_{\\infty {\\rm h}}$ configurations, H$_4$ symmetrically distorted on a circle, and lithium hydride. We moreover investigate the ability of single-reference coupled cluster solutions to approximate excited state energies. We find that multiple CC roots describe energies of excited states with high accuracy. Remarkably, our investigations reveal that for systems like lithium hydride, CC not only provides high-accuracy approximations to several excited state energies but also to the states themselves.\n",

      " Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) provide a general, minimal-assumption lan- guage for describing quantum-state preparation and measurement. They therefore provide a general language in which to express multi-agent communication protocols, e.g. local operations, classical communication (LOCC) protocols. In the accompanying Part I, we construct LOCC protocols using TQFT, and show that LOCC protocols induce quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) on the agent-environment boundary. Such QECCs can be regarded as implementing or inducing the emergence of spacetimes on such boundaries. Here we investigate this connection between inter-agent communication and spacetime, exploiting different realizations of TQFT. We delve into TQFTs that support on their boundaries spin-networks as computational systems: these are known as topological quan- tum neural networks (TQNNs). TQNNs, which have a natural representation as tensor networks, implement QECC. We recognize into the HaPPY code a paradigmatic example. We then show how generic QECCs, as bulk-boundary codes, induce effective spacetimes. The effective spatial and temporal separations that take place in QECC enables LOCC protocols between spatially separated observers. We then consider the implementation of QECCs in BF and Chern-Simons theories, and show that QECC-induced spacetimes provide the classical redundancy required for LOCC. Finally, we consider topological M-theory as an implementation of QECC in higher spacetime dimensions.\n",

This study investigates frequency fluctuations in a surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator, where reflection coefficients of 14 SAW modes are measured simultaneously for more than seven hours. We report two distinct noise characteristics. Multimode frequency noise caused by interactions with two-level system (TLS) defects shows significant degrees of correlations that diminish with increased detuning. This finding agrees with the current understanding of the parasitic TLS behavior as one of the dominant noise sources in quantum devices. In addition to the TLS-induced noise, we observe strong anomalous frequency fluctuations with slow, anti-correlated dynamics. These noise bursts resemble signatures of cosmic radiation observed in superconducting quantum systems.\n",

      " We propose a framework to design and optimize generic photonic quantum circuits composed of Gaussian objects (pure and mixed Gaussian states, Gaussian unitaries, Gaussian channels, Gaussian measurements) as well as non-Gaussian effects such as photon-number-resolving measurements. In this framework, we parametrize a phase space representation of Gaussian objects using elements of the symplectic group (or the unitary or orthogonal group in special cases), and then we transform it into the Fock representation using a single linear recurrence relation that computes the Fock amplitudes of any Gaussian object recursively. We also compute the gradient of the Fock amplitudes with respect to phase space parameters by differentiating through the recurrence relation. We can then use Riemannian optimization on the symplectic group to optimize M-mode Gaussian objects, avoiding the need to commit to particular realizations in terms of fundamental gates. This allows us to \"mod out\" all the different gate-level implementations of the same circuit, which now can be chosen after the optimization has completed. This can be especially useful when looking to answer general questions, such as bounding the value of a property over a class of states or transformations, or when one would like to worry about hardware constraints separately from the circuit optimization step. Finally, we make our framework extendable to non-Gaussian objects that can be written as linear combinations of Gaussian ones, by explicitly computing the change in global phase when states undergo Gaussian transformations. We implemented all of these methods in the freely available open-source library MrMustard, which we use in three examples to optimize the 216-mode interferometer in Borealis, and 2- and 3-modes circuits (with Fock measurements) to produce cat states and cubic phase states.\n",

      " We demonstrate a novel MIR methane sensor shifting measurement wavelength to SWIR (1.55$\\mu$m) by using non-linear interferometry. The technique exploits the interference effects seen in three-wave mixing when pump, signal, and idler modes make a double pass through a nonlinear crystal. The method allows sensing at wavelengths where detectors are poor ($>$3$\\mu$m) and detection at wavelengths where photon counting sensitivity can be achieved. In a first experimental demonstration, we measured a small methane concentration inside a gas cell with high precision. This interferometer can be built in a compact design for field operations and potentially enable the detection of low concentrations of methane at up to 100m range. Signal-to-noise ratio calculations show that the method can outperform existing short wavelength ($\\sim$1.65$\\mu$m) integrated path differential absorption direct sensing at high ($>$$10^{-4}$) non-linear gain.\n",

      " The construction of quantum circuits to simulate Hamiltonian evolution is central to many quantum algorithms. State-of-the-art circuits are based on oracles whose implementation is often omitted, and the complexity of the algorithm is estimated by counting oracle queries. However, in practical applications, an oracle implementation contributes a large constant factor to the overall complexity of the algorithm. The key finding of this work is the efficient procedure for representation of a tridiagonal matrix in the Pauli basis, which allows one to construct a Hamiltonian evolution circuit without the use of oracles. The procedure represents a general tridiagonal matrix $2^n \\times 2^n$ by systematically determining all Pauli strings present in the decomposition, dividing them into commuting subsets. The efficiency is in the number of commuting subsets $O(n)$. The method is demonstrated using the one-dimensional wave equation, verifying numerically that the gate complexity as function of the number of qubits is lower than the oracle based approach for $n < 15$ and requires half the number of qubits. This method is applicable to other Hamiltonians based on the tridiagonal matrices.\n",

      " Quantum computing has recently emerged as a transformative technology. Yet, its promised advantages rely on efficiently translating quantum operations into viable physical realizations. In this work, we use generative machine learning models, specifically denoising diffusion models (DMs), to facilitate this transformation. Leveraging text-conditioning, we steer the model to produce desired quantum operations within gate-based quantum circuits. Notably, DMs allow to sidestep during training the exponential overhead inherent in the classical simulation of quantum dynamics -- a consistent bottleneck in preceding ML techniques. We demonstrate the model's capabilities across two tasks: entanglement generation and unitary compilation. The model excels at generating new circuits and supports typical DM extensions such as masking and editing to, for instance, align the circuit generation to the constraints of the targeted quantum device. Given their flexibility and generalization abilities, we envision DMs as pivotal in quantum circuit synthesis, enhancing both practical applications but also insights into theoretical quantum computation.\n",

      " Quantum operations by utilizing the underlying geometric phases produced in physical systems are favoured due to its potential robustness. When a system in a non-degenerate eigenstate undergoes an adiabatically cyclic evolution dominated by its Hamiltonian, it will get a geometric phase, referred to as the Berry Phase. While a non-adiabatically cyclic evolution produces an Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase. The two types of Abelian geometric phases are extended to the non-Abelian cases, where the phase factors become matrix-valued and the transformations associated with different loops are non-commutable. Abelian and non-Abelian (holonomic) operations are prevalent in discrete variable systems, whose limited (say, two) energy levels, form the qubit. While their developments in continuous systems have also been investigated, mainly due to that, bosonic modes (in, such as, cat states) with large Hilbert spaces, provide potential advantages in fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we propose a feasible scheme to realize non-adiabatic holonomic quantum logic operations in continuous variable systems with cat codes. We construct arbitrary single-qubit (two-qubit) gates with the combination of single- and two-photon drivings applied to a Kerr Parametric Oscillator (KPO) (the coupled KPOs). Our scheme relaxes the requirements of the previously proposed quantum geometric operation strategies in continuous variable systems, providing an effective way for quantum control.\n",

      " Self-testing identifies quantum states and correlations that exhibit nonlocality, distinguishing them, up to local transformations, from other quantum states. Due to their strong nonlocality, it is known that all graph states can be self-tested in the standard setting - where parties are not allowed to communicate. Recently it has been shown that graph states display nonlocal correlations even when bounded classical communication on the underlying graph is permitted, a feature that has found applications in proving a circuit-depth separation between classical and quantum computing. In this work, we develop self testing in the framework of bounded classical communication, and we show that certain graph states can be robustly self-tested even allowing for communication. In particular, we provide an explicit self-test for the circular graph state and the honeycomb cluster state - the latter known to be a universal resource for measurement based quantum computation. Since communication generally obstructs self-testing of graph states, we further provide a procedure to robustly self-test any graph state from larger ones that exhibit nonlocal correlations in the communication scenario.\n",

In a limiting regime where the orbital motion of the atoms is neglected and the velocity of light tends to infinity we derive explicit non-linear stochastic differential equations describing the effective time evolution of states of individual atoms. These equations give rise to a measure on state-trajectories with quantum jumps which is a quantum-mechanical analogue of the Wiener measure of Brownian motion. Our results amount to a derivation of the fundamental randomness in the quantum-mechanical description of microscopic systems from basic principles in the context of some simple models.\n",

Yet a severe drawback remains: verification seems to require classical computation exponential in the system size, $n$. As an attempt to overcome this difficulty, we propose a new candidate for quantum advantage experiments with otherwise random \"peaked circuits\", i.e., quantum circuits whose outputs have high concentrations on a computational basis state. Naturally, the heavy output string can be used for classical verification. In this work, we analytically and numerically study an explicit model of peaked circuits, in which $\\tau_r$ layers of uniformly random gates are augmented by $\\tau_p$ layers of gates that are optimized to maximize peakedness. We show that getting $1/\\text{poly}(n)$ peakedness from such circuits requires $\\tau_{p} = \\Omega((\\tau_r/n)^{0.19})$ with overwhelming probability. However, we also give numerical evidence that nontrivial peakedness is possible in this model -- decaying exponentially with the number of qubits, but more than can be explained by any approximation where the output of a random quantum circuit is treated as a Haar-random state. This suggests that these peaked circuits have the potential for future verifiable quantum advantage experiments. Our work raises numerous open questions about random peaked circuits, including how to generate them efficiently, and whether they can be distinguished from fully random circuits in classical polynomial time.\n",

      " We introduce a hardware-specific, problem-dependent digital-analog quantum algorithm of a counterdiabatic quantum dynamics tailored for optimization problems. Specifically, we focus on trapped-ion architectures, taking advantage from global Mølmer-Sørensen gates as the analog interactions complemented by digital gates, both of which are available in the state-of-the-art technologies. We show an optimal configuration of analog blocks and digital steps leading to a substantial reduction in circuit depth compared to the purely digital approach. This implies that, using the proposed encoding, we can address larger optimization problem instances, requiring more qubits, while preserving the coherence time of current devices. Furthermore, we study the minimum gate fidelity required by the analog blocks to outperform the purely digital simulation, finding that it is below the best fidelity reported in the literature. To validate the performance of the digital-analog encoding, we tackle the maximum independent set problem, showing that it requires fewer resources compared to the digital case. This hybrid co-design approach paves the way towards quantum advantage for efficient solutions of quantum optimization problems.\n",

      " As current experiments already realize small quantum circuits on error corrected qubits, it is important to fully understand the effect of physical errors on the logical error channels of these fault-tolerant circuits. Here, we investigate a lattice-surgery-based CNOT operation between two surface code patches under phenomenological error models. (i) For two-qubit logical Pauli measurements -- the elementary building block of the CNOT -- we optimize the number of stabilizer measurement rounds, usually taken equal to $d$, the size (code distance) of each patch. We find that the optimal number can be greater or smaller than $d$, depending on the rate of physical and readout errors, and the separation between the code patches. (ii) We fully characterize the two-qubit logical error channel of the lattice-surgery-based CNOT. We find a symmetry of the CNOT protocol, that results in a symmetry of the logical error channel. We also find that correlations between X and Z errors on the logical level are suppressed under minimum weight decoding.\n",

      " It is known that the unitary matrices that can be exactly represented by a multiqubit circuit over the Toffoli+Hadamard, Clifford+$T$, or, more generally, Clifford-cyclotomic gate set are precisely the unitary matrices with entries in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[1/2,\\zeta_k]$, where $k$ is a positive integer that depends on the gate set and $\\zeta_k$ is a primitive $2^k$-th root of unity. In this paper, we establish the analogous correspondence for qutrits. We define the multiqutrit Clifford-cyclotomic gate set of order $3^k$ by extending the classical qutrit gates $X$, $CX$, and Toffoli with the Hadamard gate $H$ and the single-qutrit gate $T_k=\\mathrm{diag}(1,\\omega_k, \\omega_k^2)$, where $\\omega_k$ is a primitive $3^k$-th root of unity. This gate set is equivalent to the qutrit Toffoli+Hadamard gate set when $k=1$, and to the qutrit Clifford+$T_k$ gate set when $k>1$. We then prove that a $3^n\\times 3^n$ unitary matrix $U$ can be represented by an $n$-qutrit circuit over the Clifford-cyclotomic gate set of order $3^k$ if and only if the entries of $U$ lie in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[1/3,\\omega_k]$.\n",

      " Enhancing chemical reactions, such as $A+B \\to [\\textit{activated complex}]^\\# \\to C+D$, in gas phase through its coupling to quantum-electrodynamics (QED) modes in a dark cavity is investigated. The main result is that the enhancement of the reaction rate by a dark cavity is for asymmetric reactions (products different from reactants.) Notice that in addition to the cavity been dark, the reactants are in their ground electronic and vibrational states, i.e., it is indeed dark. Theoretical derivation, utilizing the non-Hermitian formalism of quantum mechanics (NHQM), provides conditions and guidelines for selecting the proper type of reactions that can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Nevertheless, the time-dependent simulations of such experiments can be carried out using the standard (Hermitian) scattering theory (but including the conditions derived via NHQM). We believe that this work opens a gate to new types of studies and hopefully helps to close the gap between theory and experiments in this fascinating, relatively new field of research. As an example, we demonstrate that the asymmetric reaction rates of $O+D_2\\to [ODD]^{\\#} \\to OD+D$ and $H+ArCl \\to [ArHCl]^{\\#} \\to H+Ar+Cl$ can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Contrary, the dark cavity effect on the symmetric reaction of hydrogen exchange in methane will be negligible.\n",

      " In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), variational quantum circuits (VQCs) have been widely applied in various domains, advancing the superiority of quantum circuits against classic models. Similar to classic models, regular VQCs can be optimized by various gradient-based methods. However, the optimization may be initially trapped in barren plateaus or eventually entangled in saddle points during training. These gradient issues can significantly undermine the trainability of VQC. In this work, we propose a strategy that regularizes model parameters with prior knowledge of the train data and Gaussian noise diffusion. We conduct ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of our strategy across four public datasets and demonstrate that our method can improve the trainability of VQCs against the above-mentioned gradient issues.\n",

      " In this article, we investigate periodically driven open quantum systems within the framework of Floquet-Lindblad master equations. Specifically, we discuss Lindblad master equations in the presence of a coherent, time-periodic driving and establish their general spectral features. We also clarify the notions of transient and non-decaying solutions from this spectral perspective, and then prove that any physical system described by a Floquet-Lindblad equation must have at least one \\textit{physical} non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), corresponding to an eigenoperator of the Floquet-Lindblad evolution superoperator $\\mathcal{U}_F$ with unit eigenvalue. Since the Floquet-Lindblad formalism encapsulates the entire information regarding the NESS, it in principle enables us to obtain non-linear effects to all orders at once. The Floquet-Lindblad formalism thus provides a powerful tool for studying driven-dissipative solid-state systems, which we illustrate by deriving the nonlinear optical response of a simple two-band model of an insulating solid and comparing it with prior results established through Keldysh techniques.\n",

Topological holography is a general framework that describes the generalized global symmetry and the symmetry charges of a local quantum system in terms of a slab of a topological order, termed as the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), in one higher dimension. In this work, we consider a generalization of the topological holographic picture for $(1+1)d$ fermionic quantum phases of matter. We discuss how spin structures are encoded in the SymTFT and establish the connection between the formal fermionization formula in quantum field theory and the choice of fermionic gapped boundary conditions of the SymTFT. We demonstrate the identification and the characterization of the fermionic gapped phases and phase transitions through detailed analysis of various examples, including the fermionic systems with $\\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{F}$, $\\\\mathbb{Z}_{2} \\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{F}$, $\\\\mathbb{Z}_{4}^{F}$, and the fermionic version of the non-invertible $\\\\text{Rep}(S_{3})$ symmetry. Our work uncovers many exotic fermionic quantum critical points and gapless phases, including two kinds of fermionic symmetry enriched quantum critical points, a fermionic gapless symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, and a fermionic gapless spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase that breaks the fermionic non-invertible symmetry.',\n",

       "          Quantum information theory is plagued by the problem of regularisations, which require the evaluation of formidable asymptotic quantities. This makes it computationally intractable to gain a precise quantitative understanding of the ultimate efficiency of key operational tasks such as entanglement manipulation. Here we consider the problem of computing the asymptotic entanglement cost of preparing noisy quantum states under quantum operations with positive partial transpose (PPT). A previously claimed solution to this problem is shown to be incorrect. We construct instead an alternative solution in the form of two hierarchies of semi-definite programs that converge to the true asymptotic value of the entanglement cost from above and from below. Our main result establishes that this convergence happens exponentially fast, thus yielding an efficient algorithm that approximates the cost up to an additive error $\\varepsilon$ in time $\\mathrm{poly}\\big(D,\\,\\log(1/\\varepsilon)\\big)$, where $D$ is the underlying Hilbert space dimension. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an asymptotic entanglement measure is shown to be efficiently computable despite no closed-form formula being available.\n",
